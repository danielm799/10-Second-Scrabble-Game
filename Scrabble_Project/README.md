# 10-Second-Scrabble-Game
This little thing is a Python game that I will be designing. It is meant as a requirement for the Codeacademy's Computer Science Career Path and as a personal project for myself. The program will run a game of scrabble and luck, where the player has 10 seconds to type as many words as possible using 7 specified letters before the timer runs out.
